# Dataset-Builder
The recent development in Deep Learning algorithms and libraries and their extraordinary good results in modeling phenomena, classification, estimation and, etc. make an excessive tendency to this field. Developing deep neural networks models and assessing these model performance are severely based on the good train and test data. Dataset Builder is a software for labeling images easily to make a reliable train and test datasets. Also, it has a Python extension which can use to feed our dataset to libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, and, etc. easily.
